sakaki stepping down from gentoo-on-rpi-64bit maintenance
---------------------------------------------------------

Dear fellow Gentoo and RPi enthusiast,

sadly, due to legal obligations arising from a recent change in my
'real world' job, I must announce I am standing down as maintainer
of this project with immediate effect.

For the meantime, I will leave the underlying repos up (for
historical interest, and since the images and ebuilds may be of use
still in certain applications); however, there will be no further
updates to the binhost etc. going forward, nor will I be accepting /
actioning further pull requests or bug reports from this point.

Email requests for support will also have to be politely declined,
so, please treat this as an effective EOL notice.

For further details, please see my longer post:

Gentoo _itself_ on the aarch64 / 64-bit RPi platform remains
very much a going concern of course; please see e.g.
the following forum for more details:

Many thanks for your interest in this project!

With sincere apologies,

sakaki ><
